[location]
# This is the configuration file where you define which locations and types of items you want to be made static.
# By default this config file will result in no record being patched - customize it how you see fit.
# The configuration file is case-insensitive when it comes to the location and category names.

# EXAMPLES

# Make food and silverware in your homes static
# playerhome = ["food", "silverware"]

# Make armor, weapons, alchemy ingrediants, and soul gems in stores static
# store = ["weapon", "armor", "alchemy", "soulgem"]

# Make any kind of clutter in any kind of dungeon static
# dungeon = ["clutter"]
